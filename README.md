# todoer

`todoer` is a local, SQLite-backed command-line task manager written in Go. It supports the complete day-to-day task workflow: organizing work into groups, tracking TODO, in-progress, and completed states, recording progress timestamps, reviewing tasks across groups, cleaning up completed work, and exporting task data. No account or network connection is required.

## Features

- Create and list task groups, including the automatically created `default` group
- View TODO, in-progress, completed, and total task counts for one group or all groups
- Add tasks, move them between TODO, in-progress, and completed states, and record timestamps
- List a single group's tasks or every task across groups, with sortable output
- Delete individual tasks, clear completed tasks from a group, or purge all tasks with an explicit confirmation flag
- Export group data as CSV or JSON with a custom output filename



## Install

### Homebrew

```sh
brew tap fazil-syed/tap
brew trust fazil-syed/tap
brew install todoer
```

### From source

#### Requirements

- Go 1.26.3 or later

Clone the repository and build the binary:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fazil-syed/todoer.git
cd todoer
go build -o todoer ./cmd/todoer
```

Run it from the repository with `./todoer`, or move the binary to a directory on your `PATH` to use `todoer` anywhere.

For development, you can run it without building first:

```sh
go run ./cmd/todoer --help
```

## Quick start

Every new database includes a `default` group.

```sh
# Add a task to the default group
todoer task add Buy milk

# Create a group and add a task to it
todoer group add work
todoer task add Fix login bug --group work

# View tasks and update their state
todoer task list --group work
todoer task mark-inprogress 2
todoer task complete 2
```

Use `todoer --help`, `todoer task --help`, or `todoer group --help` for the CLI's built-in help.

todoer task list -g personal -s created_at

# Show task status counts for every group, or for one group
todoer group stats
todoer group stats -g work

# Clear only completed tasks from the default group
todoer task clear

# Export the work group to work-tasks.json in the current directory
todoer task export -g work -f json -o work-tasks
```

## Data and exports

`todoer` creates its database automatically and applies bundled migrations on startup. The database is stored at:

| Platform | Location |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/todoer/todoer.db` |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/todoer/todoer.db` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\todoer\\todoer.db` |

Exports are written to the current working directory. By default, the files are named `tasks.csv` or `tasks.json`; use `--output` to supply a different base filename. Exporting with the same filename and format replaces the existing file.

## Development

```sh
go build ./cmd/todoer
```

There is currently no automated test suite in this repository.
